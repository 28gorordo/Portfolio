   What is a design portfolio? <br>
   
 An engineerâ€™s notebook or design portfolio is a book in which an  engineer will formally document, 
 in  chronological order, all of his/her work that is  associated with a specific design project. <br>
 <br>

Why do we keep one? <br>
 
-Prove the origin of an idea <br>
-Prove diligence in turning an idea into a solution <br>
-Prove when an idea became a working solution

<p style="color:ffc4f7">
Reflection: This story focusses on the ethics of when robots should be used, 
and how far is too far when it comes to using robots even if it is for the greater good. 
The story reflects asimovs first law, "A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, 
allow a human being to come to harm" and second law, "A robot must obey orders given it by 
human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law". Is invading a humans privacy harm?  
Is a robot protecting a human when it is causing the human distress? Is it okay for a robot to disobey 
the second law to proform the first law? These are some of the themes explored in this short, interactive, 
story. <br><br>
